/*
 * Interface in Java:
 * 	An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
 * The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the java 
 * interface not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
 * Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.
 * It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.
